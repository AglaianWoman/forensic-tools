# How to mount an NTFS partition for forensic investigations.
# 




$ fdisk -l imagefile.dd

Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

      Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
imagefile.dd            2048  3907029167  1953513560    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT



$ sudo mount -o ro,loop,noexec,offset=$((512*2048)),show_sys_files,streams_interface=windows imagefile.dd /mnt/


Explanation of the options:

ro
	Open the image in read only mode to prevent modification of the evidence.

loop
	Mount image as loopback device.

noexec
	Prevent execution of binaries from the image to prevent infection of the forensic workstation.

offset
	Offset where the partition starts, in bytes. Easy to calculate for the shell. just use the fdusk output.

show_sys_files
	Provides access to file system meta data. New files which are not accessible without this options are for example:
	- $AttrDef
	- $Boot
	- $BadClus
	- $Extend
	- $LogFile
	- $UpCase
	- $MFTMirr
	- $Secure
	- $Bitmap
	- $Volume

treams_interface=windows
	Privides access to NTFS named data streams. Provides information which was not accessible before like:
	$ cat /Users/<username>/Downloads/Dropbox.exe:Zone.Identifier
	[ZoneTransfer]
	ZoneId=3
